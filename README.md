# Error propagation

Three methods are done.

* Linearized

* MonteCarlo

* Quasi monte carlo (Fourier amplitude sensitivity test)

## Linearized Error Propagation
[https://github.com/leftaroundabout/uncertainly-haskell](uncertainty-haskell) also
does a linearized error propagation. However it does not name individual
sources of error, they are instead positional arguments.

## Monte Carlo
[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Probabilistic_Functional_Programming](several packages are described in)
